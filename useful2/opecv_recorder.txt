opencv VideoCapture open codec id fail check opencv_ffmpeg_arch.lib is there

some devices£¨mbp with windows£©need check
    bool wset = capture.set(CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, width);
    bool hset = capture.set(CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, height);
may got empty frame if wset or hset is false

VideoWriter writer; open failed
because opencv after build C:\d\opencv\opencv-2.4.9\3rdparty\ffmpeg
opencv_ffmpeg.dll is not moved into build out directory C:\d\opencv\build\bin
when 32bit is build, only opencv_ffmpeg_64.dll is moved
but remember important is opencv_ffmpeg.dll need add subfix 249
or writer will open fail
opencv after build need execute make install to make include directory

lession:
need a good example to check and compare in whatever case


need keep a sharp sense because other libs all have 249
